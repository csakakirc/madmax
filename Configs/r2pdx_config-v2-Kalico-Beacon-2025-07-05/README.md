This config has been tested with Klipper and Kalico on the latest klipper-toolchanger as of July 05, 2025.<br>
The only Kalico exclusive option I am currently using is under [Beacon] in printer.cfg.<br>
This config is for a 450mm Voron V2. Adjust what you need to make is suitable for your printer.<br>
The purging before a print still needs some work.
