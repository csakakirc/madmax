A lot of this can be optimized, these are the first ideas I had when converting my V2 to a Madmax.<br>
I HIGHLY recommend taking a look and getting inspiration, then seeing what you can come up with to make this better.<br>
I basically took my Micron dock, then added stuff until I got something that worked for my V2.<br>
I HIGHLY recommend using Andrews Beacon / Cartographer carriage. https://github.com/zruncho3d/madmax/blob/main/User%20Mods/andrewmcgr/XOL-A4T-Cartographer/STL/MadMaxCarriage.stl <br> Maxwell probing has been inconsistent for me with this setup.<BR>
